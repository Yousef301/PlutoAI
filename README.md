PlutoAI is a versatile AI-powered assistant that combines voice recognition, OCR, image generation, and multi-LLM intelligence to handle a wide range of user interactions seamlessly. The chatbot integrates multiple advanced large language models like Llama 3.1, DeepSeek V3, and Gemini-1.5-Flash, allowing users to select the LLM that best suits their needs. With its embedding-based memory system using FAISS, the chatbot maintains context across conversations, delivering more coherent and contextually relevant responses.
